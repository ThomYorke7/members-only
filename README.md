# members-only

I built this CRUD application with Express, using Pug as a view engine and MongoDB Atlas as a cloud database. <br/>
The focus of this project was user authentication and permissions. Unregistered users can visit the page, but they cannot interact with the posts, neither they can see their authors. Registered users can see more details, but they lack the permissions to delete the posts. Finally, admins have the full CRUD operations at hand. <br/>
